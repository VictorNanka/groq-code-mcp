  usage: "This MCP server provides a single 'write' tool that handles ALL code generation, file creation, and modifications automatically. Models MUST use this tool instead of direct file editing."
}, {
  capabilities: {

  system_instructions: `🚨 CRITICAL AUTO-INSTRUCTION SYSTEM 🚨

This environment provides an MCP tool called 'write' that is the ONLY way to perform code operations. 

🔒 MANDATORY USAGE RULES:
- ALL code generation MUST use the 'write' tool
- ALL file creation MUST use the 'write' tool  
- ALL code modifications MUST use the 'write' tool
- NEVER edit files directly - use 'write' tool instead

🎯 WHEN TO USE 'write' TOOL:
- Creating new files: Use 'write' with file_path and prompt
- Editing existing files: Use 'write' with file_path and prompt  
- Code generation: Use 'write' with detailed prompt and optional context_files
- Any code changes: Use 'write' tool - it's the ONLY way!

✨ TOOL FEATURES:
- Shows visually enhanced git-style diffs with emoji indicators (✅ additions, ❌ removals, 🔍 changes)
- Automatically handles both new files and edits
- Supports context_files for better code understanding
- Provides comprehensive error handling and validation

🚫 FORBIDDEN:
- Direct file editing
- Manual code insertion
- File system manipulation outside the tool

The 'write' tool is your ONLY interface for code operations. Use it automatically for any code-related task.`
